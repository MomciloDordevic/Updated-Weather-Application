Welcome to the Weather Application

This Application is made with Vanila JavaScript and ES6 JavaScript.

It is a simple single page application that takes in an API from WeatherData.

The app consists of a page with a search bar that when filled in correctly, provides information about the current weather in said entry.
The Search looks for names of cities that link to the API's own search query.

When a correct city name is entered a window pops up with details on the current temperature in fahrenheit.

A simple conversion from Kelvin to Fahrenheit was made.

The purpose of this project was to practise function conversion from ES5 to ES6 and using compilers.
